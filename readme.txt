After running all the sample data's to analyse I've observed that after
the zero's have been removed from the list that there is a bell curve
type of accurances of numbers. The only file that didn't show this at
all was the file with the randomly generated numbers, which makes sence
because statistically speaking something that generates random numbers
should have a rather even spread. 
As was hinted on in the intro of this assignment there are appearances of
patterns that appear all over nature. As the name of the Assignment 
hints on, there was a strong inclination (the bell curves high point) that
the number one(1) is the starting digit of a large portion of the data in the
files.
